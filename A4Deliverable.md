# Motivation
As human populations explode, new housing developments consistently encroach on native wildlife habitats. Most often this results in a significant decline in native species and wildlife as the fauna struggle to adapt to the rapid environmental changes, however certain animals such as squirrels find niches in the new urban jungles. Through this final I hope to explore how this environmental change affects squirrel behavior by analyzing the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census to find trends in human-squirrel interaction and how these trends differ from wild squirrels. 

# Analysis
The Central Park Squirrel Census is a collection of 3,023 squirrel sightings with 31 different data points recorded for each sighting. Of note are behavioral attributes like “Approaches,” “Indifferent,” and “Runs From” in reference to humans. I plan on using this data to map how squirrels in Central Park, a forest in the center of one of the biggest cities in America, have had their behavior changed by constant exposure to humans and their pets. Unfortunately I could not find the license for this data set, as the City of New York website links it to ‘thesquirrelcensus.com’ which then never mentions a license. I would ask you two (the TA, and Professor) for advice on how to proceed.

# Peer Feedback
After discussion with my peers I received two major pieces of feedback, the first is that I would need a baseline to compare the squirrel behavior to, and they know of no other squirrel datasets that might be compared to. Second, since any squirrel dataset has to be gathered by humans all data that I would be working with will be biased because of its squirrel behavior in the presence of humans. For the first concern I have found several small n <30 published articles of citizen scientists recording squirrel behavior that I can use if need be. The second is a much more valid criticism that will have to be noted, as squirrel behavior might not have changed at all when no humans are present, but since this research has its foundation in human habitat expansion I find the bias acceptable. Final note here, is that my peers were expressly interested in how the squirrels diet may have changed within urbanized environments but that is outside of the scope of this dataset.

# Unknowns and Dependencies
The biggest dependency of this project is setting up a squirrel behavior ‘baseline.’ If no other database or literature can be found on this subject this project can be the first step in establishing that baseline, at least for squirrels in central park.
